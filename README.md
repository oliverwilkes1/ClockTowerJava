### Clock Tower Java

This is a partial reimplementation of the PC port of the classic SNES horror game, with a view to improving its compatibility with modern systems. For example, you can now run the game in full screen.

The main concept is that it runs the original game's VM scripting system, rather than re-implementing everything from scratch.

##  Instructions

Place the Clock Tower for Windows 95 game files in a folder called 'game' in the root directory of Clock Tower Java. Then run the Java jar.
